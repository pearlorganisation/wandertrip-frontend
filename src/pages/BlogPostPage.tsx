The peak bloom in Tokyo and Kyoto typically occurs in late March to early April, but varies each year based on weather conditions.

In Kyoto, the Philosopher's Path and Maruyama Park are must-visits. For a unique experience, see the blossoms along the moat of Hirosaki Castle in Aomori Prefecture, where over 2,500 trees create a pink tunnel and petals floating in the water create a 'sakura carpet.'",

It typically involves gathering with friends or family under blooming trees for picnics, often with food and sake. To experience hanami like a local, arrive early to secure a good spot in popular parks, bring a tarp to sit on, and pack a selection of bento boxes and drinks.",

Their brief blooming period is seen as a metaphor for the impermanence of existence, a concept known as 'mono no aware' in Japanese aesthetics. This philosophical view celebrates the appreciation of beauty alongside the awareness of its transience, reminding viewers to cherish each moment.",

Consider purchasing a Japan Rail Pass before entering the country for cost-effective travel between cities. Pack layers, as spring weather can be unpredictable. Have a flexible itinerary that allows for adjustments based on actual blooming dates, and consider including some indoor attractions as backup plans for rainy days.",
